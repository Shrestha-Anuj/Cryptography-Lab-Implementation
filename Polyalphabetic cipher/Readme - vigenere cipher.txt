Note: The vigenere cipher encryption and decryption programs can be used to achieve vigenere, vernam, and OTP encryption and decryption.

When the key length is less than the text length then it is a vigenere cipher.
When the key length and text length are equal then this cipher is a vernam cipher.
When the key length and text length are equal and the key is uniquely used for a text then it is a OTP (One Time Pad) cipher.
